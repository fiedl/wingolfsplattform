# This class represents a user group. Besides users, groups may have sub-groups as children.
# One group may have several parent-groups. Therefore, the relations between groups, users,
# etc. is stored using the DAG model, which is implemented by the `is_structureable` method.

  # Associated Objects
  # ==========================================================================================

  # Workflows
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # These methods override the standard methods, which are usual ActiveRecord associations
  # methods created by the acts-as-dag gem 
  # (https://github.com/resgraph/acts-as-dag/blob/master/lib/dag/dag.rb).
  # But since the Workflow in the main application
  # inherits from WorkflowKit::Workflow and single table inheritance and polymorphic 
  # associations do not always work together as expected in rails, as can be seen here
  # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9628610/why-polymorphic-association-doesnt-work-for-sti-if-type-column-of-the-polymorph,
  # we have to override these methods. 
  #
  # ActiveRecord associations require 'WorkflowKit::Workflow' to be stored in the database's
  # type column, but by asking for the `child_workflows` we want to get Ã²bjects of the
  # `Workflow` type, not `WorkflowKit::Workflow`, since Workflow objects may have
  # additional methods, added by the main application.
