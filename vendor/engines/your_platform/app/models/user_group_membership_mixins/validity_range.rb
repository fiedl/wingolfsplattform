#
# In this project, user group memberships do not neccessarily last forever.
# They can begin at some time and end at some time. This is expressed by the
# ValidityRange of a membership.
#
# Examples:
#
#     membership.valid_from  # =>  time
#     membership.valid_to    # =>  time
#     membership.invalidate
# 
# Scopes:
#
#     UserGroupMembership.with_invalid
#     UserGroupMembership.only_valid
#     UserGroupMembership.only_invalid
#     UserGroupMembership.at_time(time)
#
# By default, the `only_valid` scope is applied, i.e. only memberships are 
# found that are valid at present time. To override this scope, use either
# `with_invalid` or `unscoped`.
#

  # Invalidation
  # ====================================================================================================
  
  # This method ends the membership, i.e. sets the end of the validity range
  # to the given time.
  # 
  # The following examples are equivalent (despite the return value):
  # 
  #     membership.make_invalid
  #     membership.make_invalid at: Time.zone.now
  #     membership.make_invalid Time.zone.now
  #     membership.invalidate                                    #  => membership
  #     membership.update_attribute :valid_to, Time.zone.now     #  => true
  #     
  def make_invalid(time = Time.zone.now)
    time = time[:at] if time.kind_of?(Hash) && time[:at]
    self.update_attribute(:valid_to, time)
# force evaluation of User#groups to fill cache
    self.user.groups(true)
    return self
  end
  
  # This is just an alias for `make_invalid`.
  #
  def invalidate(time = Time.zone.now)
    self.make_invalid(time)
  end
  
  # This method determines whether the membership can be invalidated.
  # Direct memberships can be invalidated, whereas indirect memberships cannot.
  # The validity of indirect memberships is derived from the validity of the direct ones.
  #
  def can_be_invalidated?
    self.direct?
  end


  # Validity Check
  # ====================================================================================================
  
  # This method checks whether the membership is valid at the given time.
  #
  # This is not to be confused with ActiveRecord's `valid` method, which checks whether the
  # record matches the requirements to store it in the database.
  #
  # The following examples are equivalent:
  #
  #     membership.currently_valid?
  #     membership.valid_at? Time.zone.now
  # 
  def valid_at?(time)
    (self.valid_from == nil || self.valid_from <= time) && (self.valid_to == nil || self.valid_to >= time)
  end

  # This method checks whether the present time lies within the validity range
  # of the membership.
  #
  def currently_valid?
    valid_at?(Time.zone.now)
  end


  # Temporal scopes
  # ====================================================================================================

    # given time.
