# This module provides the ActiveRecord::Base extension `is_structureable`, which characterizes
# a model as part of the global dag_link structure in this project. All structureable objects
# are nodes of this dag link.
# 
# Examples: 
#     @page1.parent_pages << @page2
#     @page1.parents # => [ @page2, ... ]
#     
#     @group.child_users << @user
#     @group.children # => [ @user, ... ]
#     @user.parents # => [ @group, ... ]
# 
# For all methods that are provided, please consult the documentations of the 
# `acts-as-dag` gem and of the `acts_as_paranoid_dag` gem.
# 
# This module is included in ActiveRecord::Base via an initializer at
# config/initializers/active_record_structureable_extension.rb
#
module Structureable

  # options: ancestor_class_names, descendant_class_names

  # This method is used to declare a model as structureable, i.e. part of the global 
  # dag link structure. 
  # 
  # Options:
  #   ancestor_class_names
  #   descendant_class_names
  #   link_class_name         (default: 'DagLink')
  # 
  # For detailed information on the options, please see the documentation of the
  # `acts-as-dag` gem, since these options are forwarded to the has_dag_links method.
  # http://rubydoc.info/github/resgraph/acts-as-dag/Dag#has_dag_links-instance_method
  # 
  # Example:
  #     class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       is_structureable ancestor_class_names: %w(Group), descendant_class_names: %w(Group User)
  #     end
  #     class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #       is_structureable ancestor_class_names: %w(Group)
  #     end
