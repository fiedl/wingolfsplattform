#
# Each displayed html page has got a header title tag, i.e. <html><head><title>...</title></head>...</html>.
# For a typical page, the title should be something like this: "User 'doe' - YourAppName", where the 
# first part depends on the currently shown page, the second part just contains your app's name. 
# If no first part exists, just display the app's name.
# 
# The first part of the title, i.e. the part specific to the currently shown page, 
# is set in the html view of the currently shown page, since it is only required for html responses.
# 
#    <!-- In the view, e.g. app/views/users/show.html.erb: -->
#    <% set_title("User '#{@user.alias}'") %>
#
# In the layout, the full title can be refered to as `website_title_with_app_name`.
# 
#    <!-- In the layout, e.g. app/views/layouts/application.html.erb: -->
#    <head><title><%= website_title_with_app_name %></title>...</head>
