# The dag link functionality is tested extensively in the corresponding gems `acts-as-dag` and Â´acts_as_paranoid_dag`.
# This test is just to make sure that the integration is propery done. Therefore, some basic scenarios are tested here.
#
# We use the Page model here to represent the dag's node objects, since it's a relatively simple model, which is already
# present in the database. If the Page model should become more extensive in the future, it's recommended to refactor
# this test to use a new model, perhaps defined in the test itself.
