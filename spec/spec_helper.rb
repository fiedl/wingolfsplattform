#
# This file contains the configuration of our test suite.
# We are using the following tools:
# 
# RSpec             Defining test-driven or behavior-driven specifications of 
#                   software components. 
#                   http://rspec.info/
#
# rspec-rails       Integration of RSpec into Rails, providing generators, et cetera.
#                   https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails
#
# Guard             Detecting changed files and running corresponding tests in the
#                   background during development.
#                   https://github.com/guard/guard
#
# Spork             Keeping some less frequently changing components in memory
#                   in order to increase test performance, i.e. minimize the time
#                   Guard needs to restart the tests.
#                   https://github.com/sporkrb/spork
# 
# Capybara          Simulating user interaction in order to write high level
#                   integration tests. 
#                   https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
#
# PhantomJS         Simulated browser for running integration tests headless,
#                   including the execution of JavaScript and AJAX requests.

# Required Basic Libraries
# ==========================================================================================

# These libraries are required to load Spork. Since every test requires, i.e. loads 
# this spec helper, they are loaded separately for each test run.
# 
# In order to increase performance, loading of the other libraries takes place within
# the `Spork.prefork` block. This causes the libraries being cached in memory rather 
# than being loaded for each run separately. 
#
require 'rubygems'
require 'spork'
# uncomment the following line to use spork with the debugger
# require 'spork/ext/ruby-debug'


# Requirements and Configurations Cached by Spork
# ==========================================================================================

# These requirements and configurations are loaded by Spork. Spork will cache them
# in memory. 
#
# Remember to restart Spork (kill and restart guard) whenever you need to reload one
# of the components. If you find yourself to often restarting guard because of this,
# you should probably move the concerning component into the `Spork.each_run` block.
#
Spork.prefork do


  # Required Application Environment
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'
  require File.expand_path('../../config/environment', __FILE__)


  # Required Libraries
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  require 'rspec/rails'
  require 'rspec/autorun'
  require 'nokogiri'
  require 'capybara/poltergeist'
  require 'rspec/expectations'


  # Required Support Files (that help you testing)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Requires supporting ruby files with custom matchers and macros, etc,
  # in spec/support/ and its subdirectories.
  #Dir[Rails.root.join('spec/support/**/*.rb')].each {|f| require f}
  Dir[Rails.root.join('vendor/engines/your_platform/spec/support/**/*.rb')].each {|f| require f}


  # SimpleCov: Code Coverage
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Resource on using SimpleCov together with Spork:
  # https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/42#issuecomment-4440284
  #
  unless ENV['DRB']
    require 'simplecov'
    SimpleCov.start 'rails'
  end


  # Factories, Stubs and Mocks
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Mock objects are simplified objects ("stub") that are used rather than the 
  # real, more complex objects, e.g. in order to increase performance.
  # 
  # Rather than `rspec-mocks` fixtures, we use FactoryGirl instead.
  #
  FactoryGirl.definition_file_paths = %w(spec/factories vendor/engines/your_platform/spec/factories)

  # In order to not hit the geocoding API, we use stub data for geocoding.
  #
  Geocoder.configure( lookup: :test )
  

  # Capybara & Poltergeist  Configuration
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Capybara.register_driver :poltergeist do |app|

    # The `inspector: true` argument gives you the possibility to stop the execution
    # of the tests using `page.driver.debug` in your spec code. This will open an
    # inspector in the browser that allows you to see the current DOM structure and 
    # other information useful for debugging tests.
    # 
    Capybara::Poltergeist::Driver.new(app, inspector: true)
  end
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist


  # Rspec Configuration
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  RSpec.configure do |config|

    # Inclusion of helper methods.
    # ......................................................................................
    #
    # The methods contained in the modules marked to be included here, will be 
    # available in the spec code, without being prefixed.
    #
    # For example, including the url_helpers allows to use `url_for(some_object)` 
    # in the specs.
    #
    config.include RSpec::Matchers
    config.include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
    config.include FactoryGirl::Syntax::Methods


    # Database Wiping Policy
    # ......................................................................................

    # For each separate test, the test database is wiped. There are several ways
    # to acomplish this. But, in high level integration tests, especially when
    # using AJAX requests, there may be complications:
    #   a) Several components are hitting the database: The test code as well as
    #        the simulated browser through Capybara. 
    #   b) There may be cases when asynchronous requests hit the database
    #        after passing on to the next test, when the database is wiped again
    #        already. Beware of these cases, which really produce strange errors.

      # From 40 to a couple of minutes, since the truncation method, which is slower,

    # Spec Filtering: Focus on Current Specs
    # ......................................................................................

    # By including the `focus: true` in `describe` or `it` calls in the spec code,
    # cause the test suite to focus on these blocks, i.e. run only them. This can be
    # useful if are working on a tricky one. 
    #
    # BUT REMEMBER to reove the `focus: true` before comitting the spec code.
    # Otherwise you prevent other tests from being run regularly. 
    #    
    # config.filter_run :focus => true
    #
    # EDIT: The filter is not set here, but using guar (i.e. in the Guardfile). 
    # Thus, when using `bundle exec rake`, always all specs run,
    # which is important on the server.

    # Further Rspec Configuration
    # ......................................................................................

    # automatically. This will be the default behavior in future versions of
    # rspec-rails.

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Because, in tests withs :js => true, the setting from config/application.rb is used.
  #

  I18n.locale = :de
  
  
  # Request Host
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  # Override the request.host to be http://example.com rather than the default
  # http://www.example.com. Otherwise, each spec would first trigger the non-www redirect
  # in the your_platform application controller.
  #
  # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6536503
  #
  # Edit: Does not work for all specs. 
  # For the moment, I've just deactivated the www redirect in the test env. --Fiedl
  #
  # Capybara.app_host = "http://localhost"

# Requirements and Configurations NOT Cached by Spork
# ==========================================================================================

# These requirements and configurations are loaded on each run of the test suite
# without being cached by Spork.
